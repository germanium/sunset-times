# Sunset times
This web app was inspired by the question of [why daylight saving time exists](http://visual.ly/daylight-saving-time-explained). This led to the question of how does daylight changes with location, and the answer to that is this app which is live at sunset-times.appspot.com. 

The app was built with Google App Engine, and uses the Google Maps API to find the locations, and [crepyscule](https://ptaff.ca/crepyscule/) to calculate sunset/surise times based on the position of the earth throught the year. 

The plot was created with [D3.js](d3js.org) and the colors for sunset and sunrise times were selected as the average colors from a trusted [google image search](https://www.google.com/search?rlz=1C5CHFA_enUS505US505&espv=210&es_sm=119&tbm=isch&sa=1&q=sunset&btnG=) (who knew they were different?).
